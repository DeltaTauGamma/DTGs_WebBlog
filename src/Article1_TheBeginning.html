        <p>Hello! I&#39;m so excited to have you here, for this is the first ever article on my blog!
            So to give you an in depth understanding of what I&#39;m going to do in here, I&#39;ll sum it all up
            on this very first edition of the brand new DTG&#39;S BLOG. Enjoy!</p>
        <p>At the core, what I&#39;m doing in this blog is simply documenting my different projects.
            I intend this &quot;documentation&quot; to  go all the way from my research to how I tackle the
            different issues that might come up. What kind of projects will I do? Well I&#39;m glad you asked!</p>
        <p>Firstly, most of the things I&#39;ll post in here will be mostly concerned with coding and engineering.
            Their will, of course, be articles about other things, specially as I develop my interests, but I
            am pretty confident to say that these two themes will trend almost all across the blog.</p>
        <p>Did you notice the &quot;almost&quot;? Yes, the more reading-avid ones of you will have noticed that in my
            bio it clearly says I&#39;m interested in philosophy and music, and those two are a pretty long
            way from engineering! So I&#39;d say you can guess what other topics the blog might revolve around.
            To be totally honest, I&#39;m more than an amateur in both subjects so don&#39;t expect anything
            <strong>C</strong><em>r</em><strong>A</strong>z<em><strong>Y</strong></em>.</p>
        <p>That&#39;s going to be all for this time, if you enjoyed, look forward for the next article!
            I&#39;ll be talking about a small game I&#39;m making. Without anything else to add, </p>
        <p>Until next time!</p>
